# Sopro V2 Turbo (`sopro_tts`)

[samuel-vitorino/sopro-v2-turbo](https://huggingface.co/samuel-vitorino/sopro-v2-turbo) is a
120M-parameter zero-shot voice-cloning TTS covering English, European Portuguese, French and
German, released under Apache-2.0. It clones from 5–20 s of reference audio and outputs
24 kHz mono.

> **Not the same model as `soprano_tts`.** audio.cpp's existing `soprano_tts` family is
> [ekwek/Soprano-1.1-80M](https://huggingface.co/WalkingCat/Soprano-1.1-80M-GGUF), an unrelated
> project with a Qwen3 backbone and a different decoder. Sopro V2 Turbo shares nothing with it
> beyond a similar name, so it ships as its own family. The `--family` hints `sopro`,
> `sopro_v2` and `sopro_v2_turbo` all resolve to `sopro_tts`.

## Installation

The upstream safetensors checkpoint runs directly — no conversion step:

```bash
python3 tools/model_manager_v2.py install sopro_v2_turbo_safetensors
# -> models/sopro-v2-turbo/{config.json,tokenizer.model,*.safetensors}
```

To run from GGUF instead, pack the four stages into one file. `audiocpp_gguf` takes one
namespaced input per stage, and `--root` makes it embed `config.json` and `tokenizer.model` as
sidecars, so the resulting `.gguf` is self-contained:

```bash
build/bin/audiocpp_gguf \
    --input model=models/sopro-v2-turbo/model.safetensors \
    --input semantic_encoder=models/sopro-v2-turbo/semantic_encoder.safetensors \
    --input speaker_encoder=models/sopro-v2-turbo/speaker_encoder.safetensors \
    --input vocoder=models/sopro-v2-turbo/vocoder.safetensors \
    --family sopro_tts --root models/sopro-v2-turbo \
    --output models/sopro-v2-turbo-GGUF/sopro-v2-turbo-f16.gguf --type f16
```

No public audio.cpp GGUF build of this family is published yet, so the spec's default
`sopro_v2_turbo_f16` package has `download.kind = "unsupported"` and expects the file above to
be produced locally.

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DAUDIOCPP_MODEL_SET=custom -DAUDIOCPP_MODELS=sopro_tts
cmake --build build --target audiocpp_cli -j"$(nproc)"
```

## Run

Zero-shot cloning always needs a reference clip:

```bash
build/bin/audiocpp_cli \
    --task tts --family sopro_tts \
    --model models/sopro-v2-turbo \
    --backend cpu --threads 8 \
    --text "Sopro is a lightweight text-to-speech model that runs on device." \
    --voice-ref ref.wav \
    --request-option language=en \
    --out out.wav --metrics
```

`--task clon` works the same way. The reference is resampled to 24 kHz, cropped at a pause near
`ref_seconds`, and level-normalised before the speaker and semantic encoders see it. That
normalisation is boost-only and peak-guarded (sopro 2.1): a reference already at or above the
−19.8 dB prompt level is passed through untouched, and a boost is never large enough to push
the peak past 0.95. The level the reference ends up at is what the output gain falls back to
when the generated audio is too short to measure.

## Streaming

`--mode streaming` emits one pull event per text segment instead of one buffer at the end:

```bash
build/bin/audiocpp_cli \
    --task tts --family sopro_tts \
    --model models/sopro-v2-turbo \
    --backend cpu --threads 8 --mode streaming \
    --text "$(cat article.txt)" \
    --voice-ref ref.wav --language en \
    --text-chunk-size 120 \
    --out stream.wav --out-dir segments/
```

Each event carries a `segment_<n>` named audio buffer that is already levelled, trimmed and
faded, so a consumer can play events back to back; `--out` still writes the whole utterance,
and it is exactly the concatenation of the events. The reference voice is encoded once in
`start_stream`, so every event after the first costs only its own LM, solver and vocoder pass.

**Granularity is one text segment, not one frame.** The acoustic DiT and the Vocos vocoder both
see a whole span at once, and this checkpoint ships no causal vocoder, so a segment is the
smallest unit that can leave without boundary artefacts. `text_chunk_size` is the latency dial:
on a 16-core CPU build at 8 threads, 8 solver steps and a 14 s reference, `text_chunk_size=120`
put the first audio out at ~3.1 s for a 6.7 s segment, against ~9.9 s for the same text offline.

Two things to know before turning it down further:

- Every segment re-solves the *whole* reference mel prompt alongside its own frames, so the
  per-segment cost has a floor of roughly `ref_seconds` worth of DiT work. Segments shorter
  than about 1 s take longer to generate than to play, even though the stream as a whole stays
  ahead of real time (`text_chunk_size=40` measured 0.75 RTF overall, with the shortest
  segment at 2.1). Lowering `ref_seconds` shrinks that floor at some cost to cloning fidelity.
- Streaming reproduces the offline waveform for the same `seed`, sample count included, with
  one deliberate exception: offline level-matches over the finished utterance, which a stream
  cannot see, so the first segment fixes the gain for the rest. The measured difference is a
  constant scale factor (1.15x, +1.2 dB, on the clip above) with a −47 dB residual.

## Options

| Request option | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `language` | string | *(empty)* | Prepends `<\|lang_xx\|>`; one of `en`, `pt`, `fr`, `de`. Optional, helps on ambiguous text |
| `temperature` | float | 0.8 | Semantic LM sampling temperature; `0` selects arg-max |
| `top_p` | float | 0.9 | Nucleus threshold, applied after top-k renormalisation |
| `top_k` | int | 25 | Top-k truncation; `0` disables |
| `num_inference_steps` | int | 2 | Acoustic rectified-flow Euler steps |
| `max_seconds` | float | 30.0 | Audio cap per segment; long text is split, so total length is unbounded |
| `min_seconds` | float | 0.4 | Minimum audio before the semantic LM may emit EOS |
| `ref_seconds` | float | 10.0 | Reference window used for cloning |
| `text_chunk_size` | int | 300 | Max codepoints per synthesis segment |
| `seed` | int | *(random)* | Seeds semantic sampling and the acoustic noise prior |

| Session option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sopro_tts.language` | *(empty)* | Default language tag for requests that do not set one |

| Load option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sopro_tts.matmul_weight_type` | `f32` | Storage type for matmul weights (`native`, `f32`, `f16`, `bf16`, `q8_0`) |
| `sopro_tts.conv_weight_type` | `f32` | Storage type for convolution weights (`native`, `f32`, `f16`) |

Every default comes from the checkpoint's `config.json` `generation` block, so a retrained
variant picks up its own values without a code change.

## Architecture notes

Five stages run per request, mirroring `sopro/` upstream:

1. **Text** (`text_tokenizer.cpp`) — SentencePiece unigram, 8192 pieces, plus the reference's
   punctuation clean-up and sentence/clause/word segmentation. No phonemiser.
2. **Speaker encoder** (`speaker_encoder.cpp`, ~11M) — 16 kHz log-mel into a three-stage gated
   depthwise ResNet with squeeze-excite, then attentive-statistics pooling for identity and
   multi-scale mean/std pooling for style. The convolution trunk runs on the backend; the two
   pooling heads and their MLPs run on the host, where they cost a few hundred kFLOP.
3. **Semantic encoder** (`semantic_encoder.cpp`, ~82M) — a Whisper-style front end and six
   non-causal transformer layers, resampled to one frame per 1024 output samples and quantised
   by an FSQ head with levels `[7,5,5,5,5]` (4375 codes).
4. **Semantic LM** (`semantic_lm.cpp`) — 12 pre-norm blocks, dim 512, QK RMS-norm, SwiGLU,
   half-rotation RoPE. The prompt is `[style prefix | text | carried tokens | BOS]`. Because the
   only structural difference from a Qwen3 decoder is a LayerScale vector on each residual
   branch, and those branches end in a bias-free projection, the scale is folded into that
   projection's rows at load time and the shared `QwenCausalDecodeRuntime` runs the stack
   unmodified. The eight-query style prefix cross-attention runs on the host.
5. **Acoustic head + vocoder** (`acoustic.cpp`, `vocoder.cpp`) — an 8-block adaptive-layer-norm
   DiT solving a rectified flow in two Euler steps on a sway-sampled time grid, with the prompt
   mel re-pinned after every step; then a 14-layer Vocos ConvNeXt backbone and one centred
   ISTFT. The ISTFT head is band-limited: bins at or above `vocoder.band_limit_hz` (10900 Hz by
   default, as in sopro 2.1) are zeroed before the inverse transform, which removes the
   high-frequency hiss the unlimited head produced. `mu` (the upsampled semantic conditioning)
   is built in its own graph because it is constant across solver steps.

Two implementation details worth knowing:

- **Front-end buffers come from the checkpoint.** torchaudio stores its analysis window and mel
  filterbank as persistent buffers, and all three front ends load those rather than rebuilding
  the filterbank, which removes the usual mel-parity risk. A checkpoint exported without them
  fails at load with a message naming the missing tensor.
- **Grouped convolutions are split.** The DiT's causal positional embedding uses
  `Conv1d(512, 512, k=31, groups=16)`; ggml has no grouped conv1d, so the weight is split into
  16 independent convolutions at load time.
- **The velocity graph re-uploads every leaf per Euler step.** `ggml_gallocr` exempts only
  `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_OUTPUT` tensors from being freed and reused
  (`ggml_gallocr_free_node` in `ggml-alloc.c`); an *input* leaf's arena space is handed to a
  later intermediate once its last consumer has run. That is correct for a one-shot graph, but
  the solver replays the velocity graph once per step, so staging `mu`, `cond_mel`, `cond_mask`,
  `spk` and the RoPE positions once would leave the second and later steps reading whatever
  overwrote them. `SoproAcousticGraphs::upload_constants` re-uploads all of them before every
  compute; it costs a few hundred kB per step against a multi-GFLOP DiT pass.

## Known limitations

- **Streaming is segment-level, not frame-level.** The upstream frame-level path (chunked DiT
  attention plus the causal vocoder, `vocoder_streaming.safetensors`) is not implemented, and
  that vocoder is not part of the published checkpoint this family loads. What ships is one
  pull event per text segment; see [Streaming](#streaming) for the latency it actually buys.
- **Sampling RNG is not torch-bit-exact.** `sample_next_token` reproduces the reference's
  masking, temperature, top-k and top-p arithmetic exactly, but draws from a seeded
  `std::mt19937_64` rather than torch's generator, so a given `seed` will not reproduce the
  Python output sample-for-sample. The same `seed` is reproducible within audio.cpp.
- **No `int8` AR path.** The upstream `--int8` CPU option has no equivalent; use
  `sopro_tts.matmul_weight_type=q8_0` instead.
- The text front end is deliberately minimal upstream: prefer words to symbols (`one plus two`,
  not `1 + 2`), and avoid mixing languages inside one sentence.

## Validation status

Verified against the real checkpoint on a 16-core x86-64 CPU build, 8 threads. Every stage was
reimplemented independently in numpy, driven from the checkpoint's own weights, and diffed
against the C++.

| Stage | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tensor inventory | 762 names + shapes vs. the four real files | exact match |
| Vocoder mel front end | vs. numpy STFT + checkpoint filterbank | max diff 1.9e-3 |
| Vocos backbone + ISTFT head | vs. numpy, all 14 blocks | max diff 1.0e-5 (measured before the band limit; the numpy reference does not zero the bins above 10900 Hz) |
| Semantic encoder mel | vs. numpy | max diff 1.9e-5 |
| Semantic encoder transformer | vs. numpy, all 6 layers | max diff 6.0e-5 |
| FSQ token ids | vs. numpy | 188/188 identical |
| Speaker encoder mel / trunk / heads | vs. numpy | max diff 3.7e-5 |
| Acoustic `mu`, `spk`, time embedding | vs. numpy | max diff 1.3e-5 |
| Acoustic velocity field, every Euler step | vs. numpy | max diff 5.8e-3 |
| Acoustic self-reconstruction | NMSE vs. the reference's own mel | 0.38 |
| Fixed `seed` reproducibility | byte-identical WAV across runs | pass |
| Streaming vs. offline, same `seed` | 22.5 s clip, 4 segments | identical sample count; a constant 1.15x gain, −47 dB residual |
| Streaming segment sum | segments vs. `--out` | exact |
| Long-form, 6026 chars | 371.6 s of audio, 48 segments | offline and streaming both complete; peak RSS 1.083 vs 1.086 GB |
| `matmul_weight_type` f16 / bf16 / q8_0 | runs clean | pass |
| Single-file GGUF | end to end | pass |

Numeric parity against the upstream PyTorch implementation has still not been measured
directly; the numpy references above are independent reimplementations from the same source,
which catches implementation bugs but not a shared misreading of the architecture.

### Debugging

`tests/sopro_tts/sopro_probe.cpp` (built with `-DENGINE_BUILD_WARMBENCH=ON`) exercises each
stage in isolation against a reference clip:

```bash
build/bin/sopro_probe models/sopro-v2-turbo reference.wav /tmp/soproprobe
```

It reports the `crop_on_pause` decision, a mel round trip through the vocoder (which is
phase-invariant and so the meaningful vocoder check), the FSQ token histogram, the speaker
embedding statistics, and an acoustic self-reconstruction NMSE. It also writes
`probe_vocoder_roundtrip.wav` — the reference passed through mel then the vocoder; if that
sounds like the speaker, the whole back half of the pipeline is fine.

Setting `SOPRO_DUMP_DIR=<dir>` additionally dumps the encoder and solver intermediates as raw
f32 for diffing against a reference implementation.
